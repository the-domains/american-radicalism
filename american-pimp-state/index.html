<p>Columnist E. J. Dionne (<i>Washington Post</i>) once said: “conservatives seem to believe that the rich will work harder if we give them more, and the poor will work harder if we give them less.” The inconsistency here is the result of the apparent failure to recognize that, for rich and poor alike, the possibility of earning more is an incentive to work longer, harder, and/or better. This is but a truism of human nature: incentives matter.</p><p>In <i>Colonialism from a European Perspective</i> (1957), Alexandre Kojève—noted philosopher and French bureaucrat—observed that (for Marx) capitalism had a very specific economic meaning. A capitalist economy was one which was industrialized and where the means of production were owned by an economic elite who derived all the advantages accruing from the rationalization of production. In other words, and this is the crucial point, no matter the magnitude of economic growth, the working class (or proletariat) remained at the same standard of living of minimum subsistence.</p><p>The constant struggle for survival that resulted from this situation, combined with the constant and continued increase in the relative (not absolute) poverty of the working class, supposedly made social revolution a historical necessity. And yet, as Kojève further observed, something happened on the way to our date with History.</p><p>The capitalists, foremost among them Henry Ford, had a Marxist epiphany. They realized that the progress and persistence of capitalism itself required a constant increase in the standard of living of the working class, and they acted accordingly. It is for this reason that the poor in America now enjoy the same standard of living as the middle class in many European nations (who are not exactly living in Third World conditions). And it is for this reason that capitalism (or Fordism as Kojève terms its improvement) is the greatest force ever deployed for the improvement of human welfare, both individual and collective.</p><p>America’s success, therefore, is premised upon paying a fair wage for a fair day’s work, recognizing that incentives matter, and leaving open the possibility of realizing one’s dreams. Think here of the power of the American Dream to inspire not only Americans, but individuals around the world who still see the United States as the land of opportunity, as a place where hard work and perseverance is rewarded with success. It is likely no coincidence that, as recently reported by <i>Forbes</i>, forty percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants.</p><p>While the objection implied in Dionne’s observation appears at first to be little more than an appeal to the very foundations of America’s economic success, upon a moment’s reflection it is revealed to be nothing of the sort. To see this clearly, one need only distinguish what one earns (and therefore has just claim to) from what one is given (and therefore ought to be thankful for). Only a child mistakes gifts for their due. Adults know the difference between a paycheck and a birthday present.</p><p>What Dionne ineptly tries to express is the conservative belief that <i>taking</i> more from those who work harder, longer, and/or better, and who as a result earn more, serves as a disincentive to working harder, longer, and/or better. And that <i>giving</i> more to those who have not earned it serves as a similar disincentive. Conservatives rightly ask, why work when it will be taken from (or given to) you? To the best of my knowledge, contemporary liberals, like Dionne, have no answer.</p><p>The Marxist epiphany of Fordism, again, is paying a fair wage for a fair day’s work. It is the recognition that it is in the capitalist’s interest for his worker to earn a standard of living above that which simply keeps him working, that paying such wages increases aggregate demand for the products produced and thereby fuels economic growth. Dionne’s take on the conservative belief, however, denies that anyone, worker or capitalist, earns anything. Rather, rich and poor alike, each is simply “given” either much or little by the generous “we.”</p><p>But “we” who? The answer, of course, is simple: the “we” is society, or the state, or most accurately, society working through the state.</p><p>From Hillary Clinton’s observation that “it takes a village to raise a child,” to Joe Biden’s assertion that both Michelle Obama and Dr. (!) Jill Biden “would not have any chance” without government assistance, the underlying assumption of contemporary leftists is that all success (like all truth, incidentally) is a social construct. There is no there, there. Success is simply a matter of subsidies (which explains the Obama Administration’s investment strategy in alternative energy).</p><p>Because one’s success is taken to be primarily (if not entirely) the result of society’s and not the individual’s efforts, it is society who justly has first claim on the proceeds thereof. Regardless of the amount of value created by the individual, society can justly leave to him as little as “we” decide. In sum, for contemporary leftists, no tax rate can ever be too high from the perspective of justice, and the fair share of the wealthy is whatever they feel it ought to be at that particular moment. Leftist ontology seems to come down to the following: I feel, therefore it is.</p><p>Now to be fair, contemporary leftists, like Dionne, are not seizing the wealth of the nation to throw lavish parties for their friends and family (although the past GSA scandal may raise some doubts in that regard). Rather, they seek to channel the nation’s wealth for social productive purposes, to make the right choices that individuals will not make on their own. One can fairly say they seek to maximize their understanding of the general welfare through direct government intervention and action: think Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP, PPACA, various income support programs, subsidies for politically correct sectors of the economy, etc.</p><p>In short, contemporary leftists seek to use the state to take care of everyone from cradle to grave. Hence the derisive notion of the nanny state.</p><p>When one reflects upon it, however, one sees that the nanny state is a misnomer. Nannies are caring and considerate; they seek to cultivate the independent adult within the dependent child. In other words, nannies seek to render themselves obsolete, they do not seek to infantilize those under their care so as to perpetuate their rule over them. This, however, is precisely what the contemporary welfare state seeks to do. We have a term for those who seek to infantilize others in order to perpetuate their dependency, they are called pimps.</p><p>Like a pimp on the street, the great Leviathan preys on the hopes and dreams of individuals simply looking to better their situation. It offers them a fast, secure, and easy way of realizing their dreams, with little to no cost. “The Life of Julia,” which presents a life of dependency defined by the relationship between Julia and the government, however, is no <i>Pretty Woman</i>. Julia Roberts was an <i>independent</i> contractor.</p><p>Like a pimp on the street, when contemporary leftists look at the American people they see a bunch of rural, country bumpkins who require direction and instruction from their urban and urbane betters. Or as Kenny Red, one of the notorious stars of <i>American Pimp</i> put it, “If a ho don’t get no instruction she be heading for self destruction.” For leftists today, “We the People” are the ho in need. We are in need of their direction and guidance, because like a ho without a pimp we might not make the right choices.</p><p>When he was asked in <i>American Pimp</i> to justify the pimp’s claim to one hundred percent of the proceeds of his hoes’ labor, Bishop Don Magic Juan (perhaps America’s most famous pimp), provided what could easily be inscribed upon a monument raised to the mighty Leviathan: “I supply the food; I supply the shelter; I supply the clothing; I supply the medical bills; I take care of everything, all she has to do is supply the money.”</p><p>That is what the great pimp daddy Leviathan offers to us: a world where all we are asked to do is lie back and think of America.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="19"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="20"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="21"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="22"><span data-reactid="23"><!-- react-empty: 24 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="25"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="26">American Pimp State</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="29"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
