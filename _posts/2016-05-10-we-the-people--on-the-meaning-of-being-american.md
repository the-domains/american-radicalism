What does it mean to be American? The answer requires going to the root of the question, to the origins of America itself. The project of seeking to articulate, restore, preserve, and defend these origins is American Radicalism. This project is a call to live up to the examples provided by our ancestors, by those who called upon us all to live up to the ideals of the American regime. It is a call to re-found our political community so that it may continue "to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity." 

From the beginning, the meaning of being an American was separated from questions of race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin. For all intents and purposes, those who populated the colonies prior to the founding were, like those who remained in Britain, English Protestants. Nevertheless, in declaring their independence from the Crown, these would-be Americans distinguished themselves from their English brethren. They articulated how they too formed a unity independent of albeit related to that unity which comprises the English people.

The _[Declaration of Independence][0]_ declares Americans to be "one people" who "hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." Just as it recognizes the natural equality of individuals _per se_, the Declaration also recognizes "the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle" peoples _per se_. The recognition of the natural equality of both the rights of individuals and the sovereignty of peoples defines the American mind; it distinguishes Americans from every previous people that defined all other peoples as subhuman and barbarian---that is, fit only to be ruled.

It seems natural that a people defined by ideas is predisposed to idealism, that in rejecting the extreme view that other peoples are fit only to be ruled Americans seem ready to accept the opposite extreme that all other peoples are fit for self-rule and, by implication, that all peoples are fit for life within the American regime. Given the universal nature of the ideas that compose the American mind, it also seems natural that individuals the world over who come to share in it come to see themselves as [Born American, But in the Wrong Place][1]. Naturally the American mind finds it perfectly reasonable that such individuals would seek to redress Fortune's geographic oversight. Thus, it is readily understandable why "The prevailing view among mainstream scholars and in the popular media," observed by Thomas G. West in _[Vindicating the Founders][2]_, "is that if we believe in human equality, it is unfair to deny entry to anyone. \[And why\] Especially objectionable, in their view, was the earlier practice considering the potential immigrants' national origin in determining immigration policy."

In fact, this prevailing view appears distinctly American.

If every individual who sought to immigrate to the United States already shared in the American mind, the open-borders favored by some would not be a problem---there is no limit to the number of _Americans_ who can live freely pursuing happiness under the regime established by the Constitution. In fact, if Madison's argument, made in [_The Federalist Papers_ no. 10][3], regarding the extended republic is correct, the more the merrier. Unfortunately, however, not every individual who arrives at America's shores shares this mindset. Because no one can peer into the soul of another one simply cannot know how many do or do not. Prudence, therefore, requires that one assume all potential immigrants are of the latter sort and, thus, _must be made into Americans_.

In light of this, and given the fact that resources are scarce, even if all individuals are assumed to be fit for self-rule, and by implication, life within the American regime, there is a limit to the number that can be naturalized at any one time, that is, if the essential American character of the regime is to be maintained. In fact, the word 'naturalized' points to the reason why immigration must be limited (note, not prohibited): The process of naturalization seeks to cultivate within an individual that which likely would have been cultivated merely by living within the regime since birth. In other words, the naturalization process seeks to reform or even replace the individual's first nature, passively cultivated by their previous regime, by cultivating actively a second nature. Of course, the passive process of habituation within any regime is imperfect. Just as there are those who are born American in other regimes, so too some American citizens who have been reared within the regime since birth will not share in either the American mind or the corresponding American habits, that is, their nature will be more suited to a regime other than that of the United States. It is necessary to realize that while the regime is a dominant influence on the nature of those who live under it, strictly speaking, it is not a determinative one.

The necessity of naturalization points, moreover, to the reason why American citizenship cannot be based upon merely being a member of the American people---beliefs are essentially private and not subject to verification. Even if an individual, either born into the American regime or coming from elsewhere, says he or she believes the self-evident truths of the _Declaration_, he or she could always be lying---and this remains the case even if the individual can provide a vigorous defense thereof. Even those who share the American mind must undergo the process of naturalization. (As an aside, stricktly speaking, if citizenship were dependent upon holding the truths of the _Declaration_ to be self-evident, no individual could be born an American citizen, as no individual is born knowing these truths. The truths of the _Declaration_, like all other truths, must be recognized and grasped by the rational capacity of the human intellect, a capacity that must be cultivated by education both formal and informal.) Thus, being an American and being an American citizen necessarily are two different things, neither of which is necessarily dependent upon the other. In discussing precisely who is an American citizen, therefore, it is possible to set aside the question of precisely who is an American. It is not possible, however, to set aside the founding principles of the American regime the adherence to which defines Americans generally; rather, the opposite is the case. American citizenship must be consistent with the principles of the _Declaration_.
