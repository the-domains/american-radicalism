Here's a thought experiment: walk up to a random person anywhere in the world and offer them $1,000 USD, a ticket to America, and a Greencard. Here's the catch: the offer is only good for 24 hours, wait any longer and like that ... it's gone! How many take the opportunity and run with it? At one point in recent American history, I think you could safely have said at least ninety-five percent (if not ninety-nine percent) of people would have without hesitation. And today? Who knows? I certainly don't. But what I do know is that it would be more people than the number who would take the same offer to any other country in the world. To that extent, American remains exceptional, it continues to be seen by those outside of it as the land of opportunity, the place where anyone can make it if only they work hard enough. In fact, it is the opportunity that America presents to the world that is largely (but not entirely) the cause of the persistent problem of illegal immigration and the related problem of birthright tourism. Who doesn't want to win the lottery of life by being born American?

Who is an American citizen? Since the time of Aristotle, we have known that it is the laws of the political community that determine who is and is not granted full political status within it. America is unexceptional in this regard: Here too it is the laws that decide. In fact, two types of law are involved---constitutional and statutory. For the most part, the law is clear and the question of citizenship unproblematic. Citizens give birth to citizens, whether those citizens reside at home or abroad. Controversy enters the picture, however, when the question turns to the birth of citizens to non-citizens.

To clarify, no one argues that the children born to American citizens here in the United States are not also American citizens. Similarly, no one argues that the children born to non-Americans outside the United States are American citizens. That children born abroad to American citizens are citizens also goes uncontested (except when one such individual seeks the presidency). The increasingly contentious category, the one that makes the question of American citizenship a contemporary political problem is the birth of children to non-Americans here in the United States, generally, and the children born to those whose residence contravenes American law.

What's the answer? Simply stated, it depends. The truth of the matter is complicated.

Having earlier examined (albeit briefly) the origin of the American people in the _Declaration_, the following will turn to the ultimate origin of the American citizen in the Constitution. Specifically, it will seek to provide a definitive interpretation of the meaning of the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment generally, and of the subordinate clause "and subject to the jurisdiction thereof" in particular. In doing so, it will consult both _Elk v. Wilkins___and _U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark_, the two Supreme Court cases that bear directly upon this question, as well as various texts of political philosophy and American civic history. It ultimately contends that when properly understood the aforementioned two rulings can be reconciled one with the other, and that together they answer the question asked above. While the notions of sovereign jurisdiction and community claiming that are uncovered will settle the general meaning of the sentence in question, this notion of jurisdiction will not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether or not the children of illegal aliens are constitutionally entitled to birthright citizenship. Rather, it will raise new and important questions in this regard the answers to which may point the way toward a solution.
