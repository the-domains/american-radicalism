Radicalism
is a counterintuitive notion to associate with the project sketched here. Most
often when we hear the word radical, we think of left-wing agitators seeking
political revolution, of black-clad anarchists rioting at the latest meeting of
the G-7\. This understanding is reflected in the definition above: the radical
is the one seeking to enact far-reaching, fundamental change in the nature of
political society.

But there is another understanding of radical, which is also found in the above definition---the radical is the root of something. It is this meaning of the word radical that is here invoked. This project seeks to uncover the roots of American exceptionalism with the aim of strengthening them. What is sought is an articulation of American rootedness, an understanding of the American tradition of limited government and individual rights where the end of government is the protection of persons and property, that is, the protection of individuals and the unequal results of their individual labor.

For more than 100 years, there has been a concerted attack upon these roots. Progressive radicals have sought fundamental change in the character and purpose of American government, to depart from and to replace limited government with empowered government in the service of group "rights," to establish a government that will deliberately distribute benefits within society so as to guarantee an "equal" result. Their hostility goes even so far as the Constitution that establishes the separation of powers, preferring an organic, parliamentary system of despotism punctuated by elections.

While this progressive project has not succeeded in toto, a positive view thereof now dominates within certain cultural and governmental institutions (especially in education, arts, entertainment, bureaucracy, and the judiciary) that seek to actualize it by hook or by crook. What cannot be won by means of the ballot is being imposed by executive fiat or judicial decree. Those who used to protest The Man have become The Man; those who used to protest The Establishment, now are The Establishment. Gramsci's slow march through the institutions has proved remarkably successful, so much so that the progressive, socialist, leftist mindset is simply taken for granted by a significant number of people who wield a significant amount of influence and power within America.

No
doubt many of those pushing this agenda believe that the theory of socialism
can be effectively separated from its historical practice, that mass murder is
not a necessary result of their collectivist ambitions. Many more of them are
simply historically illiterate when it comes to this issue; they simply do not
know that more than 100 million people have died in an effort to reestablish paradise
in the here and now. It is to these people of good will, to those who have a
genuine concern for the promotion of human flourishing, that this project is
addressed.
