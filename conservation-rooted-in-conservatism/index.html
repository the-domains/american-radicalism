<p><b>Conservation Rooted in Conservatism</b></p><p>Adherents to the carbon driven interpretation of global climate change (GCC) would have us believe that science is about consensus; in fact, it is about truth. Consensus is not proof of truth, nor is truth a guarantor of consensus.</p><p>Certain facts in the scientific and political debate over GCC are just that, facts, undeniable statements regarding the current condition of reality.</p><p>For example, the earth’s climate is changing; but that has always been, and will always be, the case. For its entire history its climate has been either warming or cooling, it has never been stable.</p><p>Moreover, we know the direction of contemporary change: global temperatures are rising. What we don’t know is precisely why they are doing so.</p><p>Is it the increased intensity of the activity of the sun? Or, decreases in cloud cover? Or, increases in greenhouse gases? Perhaps a combination of all three, or a cause we have yet to discover? No single theory presented today accounts for all the variance in the historical climate record, which is to say climatological science cannot explain fully the earth’s changing climate.</p><p>Every person knows, however, that we do not need perfect information in order to act. Thus, the question is, do we know enough scientifically to make political action effective?</p><p>Many individuals who believe in carbon-driven GCC say ‘yes.’ In addition they claim to know what action would most be effective.</p><p>Their prescription for this ‘global fever’ is a drastic reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by, for example, reducing the use of fossil fuels for energy production, the use of fertilizers for high intensity agriculture, and our dependence on livestock, such as cattle, as a human food source. One could say the cure for this fever is not more cowbell but less.</p><p>If this prescription were to be filled, what, according to these ‘doctors,’ would be the outcome of the treatment? Would we see the earth cool, perhaps return to pre-warming temperatures? No. Would we see global average temperatures stabilize at or around what they are today? No.</p><p>What we would see is a marginal reduction in the inevitable, long-term temperature increase. In other words, temperatures would continue to rise, but marginally less so.</p><p>The fact that a drastic reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions would produce only a marginal decrease in the rate of global temperature increase certainly seems to suggest that human activity is only of marginal influence on the earth’s climate, that the main driver lies elsewhere.</p><p>But that is a scientific issue, and one that is irrelevant to the political debate over what actions need to be taken and when.</p><p>The fact that the anti-GCC measures currently under consideration, such as the Kyoto Protocol, are of little to no use in preventing GCC points to a political issue of grave import for the future, not only of the United States, but also of humanity entire.</p><p>We know for a fact that global temperatures will continue to rise, whether the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol are achieved or not. This fact points to the need to deal with the material effects of rising temperatures, for instance, a rise in the level of the oceans, a shift in the agricultural value of land, and/or a change in the location and availability of fresh water, all of which likely will be accompanied by a shift in population patterns.</p><p>To deal with such issues humanity does not require immediate action on a global scale undertaken by the various governmental and non-governmental agencies that currently seek to ‘help’ by offering one-size fits all solutions. Rather, humanity’s survival will require the freedom necessary to pursue gradual, local accommodation to the changing local circumstances it encounters.</p><p>In other words, humanity will have to evolve.</p><p>The evolutionary process is not subject, and cannot be subjected, to centralized planning and control. Instead it is a free, spontaneous reactionand adaptation to new circumstances, much like spontaneous shifts in markets.</p><p>Every market is different from every other, with market solutions varying across all. Likewise, the local conditions that will need to be addressed and the solutions to address them will vary across both time and place.</p><p>Evolutionarily this makes sense. Just as it is the particular, local circumstances that drive the evolutionary process and result in the myriad species that populate the earth, so too the particular, local effects of GCC will drive the human reaction to it, leading to myriad solutions adapted to local conditions.</p><p>The similarity does not end there. Both processes of adaptation are gradual and experimental, taking place over time and consisting of much trial and error. Thus, GCC’s effects will only be addressed when the solutions dreamt up by the centralized bureaucracies in Washington, D.C., New York, and Brussels, give way to those resulting from decentralized, local experimentation.</p><p>In the final analysis, it seems that the slogan ‘Think Globally, Act Locally’ is correct.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">american-radicalism</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
