<p><b></b></p><p><b data-grid-id="8b037222-c5bd-4811-88f3-1cf07378226e">Conclusions on American Citizenship</b></p><p>The foregoing posts revealed that the notion of “jurisdiction” referred to in the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment is that of the sovereign jurisdiction of the people of the United States, and that this sovereign jurisdiction is the root of American citizenship and the allegiance derived there from. Furthermore, the sovereign claims of the political community embodied in its laws and enforced by its government are limited in fact or in law only by the sovereign claims of other political communities, claims backed by war or the threat thereof. Finally, the notion of sovereign jurisdiction is prior to that of legal jurisdiction; in fact, the latter is derived from the former. For example, the reason why the children of diplomats are not citizens at birth is not because they are not subject to the laws of the United States – the one is not the cause of the other. Rather, their being exempt from the sovereign jurisdiction of the United States causes both. Thus, legal jurisdiction is irrelevant to the question of whether a particular individual falls under the jurisdiction appealed to in the Fourteenth Amendment, except insofar as it is an indication that the individual in question may be outside the sovereign jurisdiction of the United States. It should be noted in this regard that congressmen are partially exempt from the legal jurisdiction by the Constitution (I.6.i). Nevertheless they are wholly subject to the sovereign jurisdiction of the United States.</p><p>The question of whether a particular individual is “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” at birth is factual, not definitional. That is, it is a question of whether another community claims said individual and can enforce said claim; or, of whether the United States recognizes such a claim and defers to it, deference that must be established in law. In either case, the claims of the United States are limited de facto and/or de jure. While Congress does have complete power over naturalization, this power does not reach to birthright citizenship – these are separate and distinct and the latter is guaranteed through the Constitution. Nor can Congress simply define by law what it means to be “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” To argue such is essentially to suggest that words have no meaning, for if one accepts that Congress can define the words of the Constitution where does it stop? If Congress by normal legislation can define who is “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” without regard to the reality of whether or not the persons actually are or are not so subject, then the Fourteenth Amendment provided no more protection than the Civil Rights Act of 1866, that is, normal legislation could have deprived the freed slaves of their citizenship and rights. “Of course fiddling with definitions independent of the realities to which they refer is the very definition of solipsism” (Codevilla and Seabury 2006,140).</p><p></p><p>In the particular instance of the children of illegal immigrants, therefore, the question is whether they exist in a state analogous to either the children of diplomats or other agents of foreign governments (exempt de jure), the children born within territory under foreign control, either inside or outside the geographic bounds of the United States (exempt de facto), or the children of the Indian tribes (exempt both de facto and de jure). Three questions that could be asked are: did the illegal immigrants enter the United States at the behest of their own government, that is, are they in some sense agents of another sovereign? Or, are communities of illegal immigrants ‘no-go’ areas akin to the bandlieues of France where French sovereign authority has been supplanted? Or, finally, are crimes that are committed by illegal immigrants where illegal immigrants are the victims exempt either de jure or de facto from American criminal justice system? The answers to these questions may reveal whether or not illegal immigrants are “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">american-radicalism</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
