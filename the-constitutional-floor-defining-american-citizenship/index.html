<p><b></b></p><p><b>The Constitutional Floor: Defining American Citizenship</b></p><p>The Fourteenth Amendment declares, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Prior to this amendment, the Constitution did not define who was “a citizen of the United States.” It did, however, recognize two sources of citizenship: birth, in reference to the requirement that an individual be “a natural born Citizen” to be eligible for the Office of the President; and naturalization, in granting to Congress the power “To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.” </p><p>This new declaration secured constitutional citizenship to all persons who met the two conditions set down therein: the one geographic, the other jurisdictional. Mere birth within the United States would not lead to citizenship, nor would birth within its jurisdiction. Instead, these two circumstances had to coincide at the instant of birth.</p><p>The principal purpose of the new declaration was to secure the citizenship and rights of newly freed slaves by placing it beyond the merely legislative power of the national and state legislatures, and by making state citizenship derivative of national (<i>i.e.</i>, reversing their previous relationship). This new declaration, then, could be thought of as simply actualizing the promise of the old. The Fourteenth Amendment, insofar as it removes the matter of citizenship of a certain class of individuals from the normal legislative process, serves as a floor below which Congress cannot go in recognizing who are citizens; there is no ceiling, however, to who Congress can grant citizenship.</p><p>While the geographic requirement is reasonably clear (although not entirely due to the past existence of situations like the Panama Canal Zone), the subordinate clause “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” is transparent as mud. In fact, the persistent problem of illegal immigration in the United States (which some—not unreasonably—think is encouraged by the existence of birthright citizenship), can be thought of as mudwrestling over the meaning of the latter.</p><p>The controversy has nothing to do with the question of whether or not Congress has the authority—under the constitutional grant of power in I.8.iv—to control immigration into the United States, for there is no question in that regard. The controversy, rather, is regarding birthright citizenship and precisely to whom it is constitutionally guaranteed. The common understanding of birthright citizenship is that the jurisdiction referred to in the Fourteenth Amendment is geographical, meaning simply being born in America makes one an American. By construing the jurisdictional requirement geographically, however, the common understanding renders the subordinate clause redundant. But it is a cannon of legal interpretation that every word must have meaning unless it leads to absurd results. Thus, “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” must mean something other than ‘subject to the geographic jurisdiction thereof.’</p><p>As an alternative, some suggest “jurisdiction” be construed as “political or complete jurisdiction,” as in owing allegiance to the United States and no other state. At least on the surface, there seems to be a contradiction present in reading the jurisdiction referred to in the Fourteenth Amendment in terms of allegiance while simultaneously rejecting feudal allegiance as the foundation of citizenship in favor of republican consent on the part of the individual and the political community. While it is correct that reciprocal consent is necessary to acquire citizenship by means of naturalization, and that naturalization gives rise to the exclusive allegiance one could characterize as political or complete jurisdiction—as all other allegiances are renounced in taking the<i>Oath of Allegiance</i>—one would err if one were to conflate this one source of citizenship with the other distinct source recognized in the constitution both pre- and post-Fourteenth Amendment—birth.</p><p>In the first instance, in no meaningful way does any political community ever consent to the particular birth of a child within it; rather, children are born and (as Aristotle correctly contends), the laws determine who among those born are citizens. This latter principle can be found in Justice Gray’s majority opinion delivered in the Supreme Court case <i>U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark </i>1898, 169 U.S. 649, wherein it is stated, “Nor can it be doubted that it is the inherent right of every independent nation to determine for itself, and according to its own constitution and laws, what classes of persons shall be entitled to its citizenship” (668). The particular laws of the community may or may not grant citizenship on the basis of birth, qualified or unqualified; but if they do, the laws embody the prior general consent of the people to recognize certain particular individuals who have yet to be born, but who at the instant of birth meet certain legal requirements, as full members in the political community and, thus, entitled to citizenship. In the case of the United States a qualified birthright citizenship is recognized in the laws (and in the Constitution no less), and the particular newborns that meet the requirements of the laws, either constitutional or statutory, have something akin to a property right in regard to their claim to citizenship (cf. Hegel, <i>Philosophy of Right</i>, §174). Thus, it would be a mistake to assert that birthright citizenship contradicts republican consent. Rather, birthright citizenship exists <i>because </i>the American people have consented to it, a general consent embodied in the actions of the Founders, and furthered by those who drafted and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment. The question of who precisely is constitutionally guaranteed birthright citizenship, however, still remains.</p><p>While the alternative conception of political or complete jurisdiction at first glance seems plausible, in the final analysis it falls to the same objection as the geographic construal of the common understanding. Simply ask the question ‘who owes allegiance to a government?’ The answer is ‘its citizens.’ Just as the sentence “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the geographic jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside” contains a redundancy, so too does “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the political jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” The redundancy is seen by translating what is meant by ‘political jurisdiction’ in the second sentence: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and owing exclusive allegiance thereto, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” And finally: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and who are citizens of the United States, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” In light of this, it seems necessary to conclude that construing the subordinate clause “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” as ‘and owing exclusive allegiance’ is to do little more than to define being a citizen by being a citizen. In fact, are we not concerned with determining who in fact owes allegiance?</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="19"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="20"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="21"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="22"><span data-reactid="23"><!-- react-empty: 24 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="25"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="26">The Constitutional Floor: Defining American Citizenship</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="29"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
